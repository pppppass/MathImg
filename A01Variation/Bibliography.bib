	abstract = {Wavelet frame based models for image restoration have been extensively studied for the past decade (Chan et al. in {SIAM} J. Sci. Comput. 24(4):1408–1432, 2003; Cai et al. in Multiscale Model. Simul. 8(2):337–369, 2009; Elad et al. in Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal. 19(3):340–358, 2005; Starck et al. in {IEEE} Trans. Image Process. 14(10):1570–1582, 2005; Shen in Proceedings of the international congress of mathematicians, vol. 4, pp. 2834–2863, 2010; Dong and Shen in {IAS} lecture notes series, Summer program on “The mathematics of image processing”, Park City Mathematics Institute, 2010). The success of wavelet frames in image restoration is mainly due to their capability of sparsely approximating piecewise smooth functions like images. Most of the wavelet frame based models designed in the past are based on the penalization of the ℓ 1 norm of wavelet frame coefficients, which, under certain conditions, is the right choice, as supported by theories of compressed sensing (Candes et al. in Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal., 2010; Candes et al. in {IEEE} Trans. Inf. Theory 52(2):489–509, 2006; Donoho in {IEEE} Trans. Inf. Theory 52:1289–1306, 2006). However, the assumptions of compressed sensing may not be satisfied in practice (e.g. for image deblurring and {CT} image reconstruction). Recently in Zhang et al. ({UCLA} {CAM} Report, vol. 11-32, 2011), the authors propose to penalize the ℓ 0 “norm” of the wavelet frame coefficients instead, and they have demonstrated significant improvements of their method over some commonly used ℓ 1 minimization models in terms of quality of the recovered images. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called the mean doubly augmented Lagrangian ({MDAL}) method, for ℓ 0 minimizations based on the classical doubly augmented Lagrangian ({DAL}) method (Rockafellar in Math. Oper. Res. 97–116, 1976). Our numerical experiments show that the proposed {MDAL} method is not only more efficient than the method proposed by Zhang et al. ({UCLA} {CAM} Report, vol. 11-32, 2011), but can also generate recovered images with even higher quality. This study reassures the feasibility of using the ℓ 0 “norm” for image restoration problems.},

	abstract = {We present a new image editing method, particularly effective for sharpening major edges by increasing the steepness of transition while eliminating a manageable degree of low-amplitude structures. The seemingly contradictive effect is achieved in an optimization framework making use of L0 gradient minimization, which can globally control how many non-zero gradients are resulted in to approximate prominent structure in a sparsity-control manner. Unlike other edge-preserving smoothing approaches, our method does not depend on local features, but instead globally locates important edges. It, as a fundamental tool, ﬁnds many applications and is particularly beneﬁcial to edge extraction, clip-art {JPEG} artifact removal, and non-photorealistic effect generation.},
