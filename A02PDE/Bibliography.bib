	abstract = {A new definition of scale-space is suggested, and a class of algorithms used to realize a diffusion process is introduced. The diffusion coefficient is chosen to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage intraregion smoothing rather than interregion smoothing. It is shown that the 'no new maxima should be generated at coarse scales' property of conventional scale space is preserved. As the region boundaries in the approach remain sharp, a high-quality edge detector which successfully exploits global information is obtained. Experimental results are shown on a number of images. Parallel hardware implementations are made feasible because the algorithm involves elementary, local operations replicated over the image.{\textless}{\textless}{ETX}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Shock filters for image enhancement are developed. The filters use new nonlinear time dependent partial differential equations and their discretizations. The evolution of the initial image \$u\_0 (x,y)\$ as \$t {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}infty \$ into a steady state solution \$u\_{\textbackslash}infty  (x,y)\$ through \$u(x,y,t)\$, \$t {\textgreater} 0\$, is the filtering process. The partial differential equations have solutions which satisfy a maximum principle. Moreover the total variation of the solution for any fixed \$t {\textgreater} 0\$ is the same as that of the initial data. The processed image is piecewise smooth, nonoscillatory, and the jumps occur across zeros of an elliptic operator (edge detector). The algorithm is relatively fast and easy to program.},

	abstract = {Anisotropic diffusion filtering is highly dependent on some crucial parameters, such as the conductance function, the gradient threshold parameter and the stopping time of the iterative process. The various alternative options at each stage of the algorithm are examined and evaluated and the best choice is selected. An automatic stopping criterion is proposed, that takes into consideration the quality of the preserved edges as opposed to just the level of smoothing achieved. The proposed scheme is evaluated with the help of real and simulated images, and compared with other state of the art schemes using objective criteria.},
