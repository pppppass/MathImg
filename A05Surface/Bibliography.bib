	abstract = {Applications of wavelet frames to image restoration problems (e.g. image deblurring and inpainting) have been successful due to their redundancy and capability of sparsely approximating piecewise smooth functions like images (see e.g. [13, 14, 8]). However, wavelet frames have not yet been used for surface reconstruction problems. Recently in [6], connections between one of the wavelet frame based image restoration model [8, 28, 48] and variational models (e.g. the {ROF} model [45]) were rigorously established. Such connections not only grant new insights to wavelet frame based image restorations, it also case a geometric explanation to wavelet frame based approaches. This leads us to a wavelet frame based model, as well as a fast algorithm, to reconstruct implicit surfaces from unorganized point sets in R3. We will demonstrate the eï¬€ectiveness of the proposed model using several commonly used examples.},
