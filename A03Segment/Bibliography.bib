	abstract = {A coupled level set method for the motion of multiple junctions (of, e.g., solid, liquid, and grain boundaries), which follows the gradient flow for an energy functional consisting of surface tension (proportional to length) and bulk energies (proportional to area), is developed. The approach combines the level set method of S. Osher and J. A. Sethian with a theoretical variational formulation of the motion by F. Reitich and H. M. Soner. The resulting method uses as many level set functions as there are regions and the energy functional is evaluated entirely in terms of level set functions. The gradient projection method leads to a coupled system of perturbed (by curvature terms) Hamilton–Jacobi equations. The coupling is enforced using a single Lagrange multiplier associated with a constraint which essentially prevents (a) regions from overlapping and (b) the development of a vacuum. The numerical implementation is relatively simple and the results agree with (and go beyond) the theory as given in [12]. Other applications of this methodology, including the decomposition of a domain into subregions with minimal interface length, are discussed. Finally, some new techniques and results in level set methodology are presented.},

	abstract = {Variational models for image segmentation have many applications, but can be slow to compute. Recently, globally convex segmentation models have been introduced which are very reliable, but contain {TV}-regularizers, making them difficult to compute. The previously introduced Split Bregman method is a technique for fast minimization of L1 regularized functionals, and has been applied to denoising and compressed sensing problems. By applying the Split Bregman concept to image segmentation problems, we build fast solvers which can out-perform more conventional schemes, such as duality based methods and graph-cuts. The convex segmentation schemes also substantially outperform conventional level set methods, such as the Chan-Vese level set-based segmentation algorithm. We also consider the related problem of surface reconstruction from unorganized data points, which is used for constructing level set representations in 3 dimensions. The primary purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of “Split Bregman” techniques for solving these problems, and to compare this scheme with more conventional methods.},
